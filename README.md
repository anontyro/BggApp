# Board Game Geek App (Android)

A native Android app that was created to allow me to practice some more of the advanced aspects such as parsing from web APIs
and many database calls. The application connects to the popular boardgame site and allows the user to download anyones list of
games. This is then stored locally and the idea would be to compaire lists and parameters.

The application is unfinished and requires adding of filters to allow the user to cross-reference aspects of lists. I would
like to finish this app when I have more time for more complex Android projects
